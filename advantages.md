Several major advantages of LanSong's cutouts.
LanSong livestream cutouts, the top choice for high-end livestreaming
1. Simplicity:
  - Green screen cutouts are generally set up in two ways: point-based or calibration. LanSong's cutout algorithm uses calibration, and it intelligently implements one-click calibration. With just a click of a button, it automatically reads the current image, analyzes the green components, identifies the non-green components, and then quickly generates a calibration map using AI. From click to completion, it typically takes less than a second, making it incredibly fast and easy.
  - A side note: Point-based cutouts require the green screen to be perfectly flat, requiring the reading of mostly identical pixel values to ensure full coverage. If the screen is uneven, masked, or has uneven lighting, the cutouts will be very clean, leaving large areas of shadows in areas significantly different from the cutouts.
2. True hair-like quality.
  - This method achieves true hair-like quality without breakage, clumping, or gloss. Under the spotlight, a person's hair isn't completely black, but rather a glossy, bright black. If the background lighting is poor and there's a green cast, the black hair will appear glossy, dark green. Against the green background, the human eye perceives it as black. This puts the image cutout algorithm to a critical test: it must remove the green, but the dark green is also green, so it can't be cut out.
3. Color Correction
  - There are two types of color correction: overflow and color correction. Overflow correction corrects the green cast back to its original color, such as clothing, skin, or white. Lansong Cutout offers three overflow correction algorithms: Fine, Classic, and Custom, tailored to suit different scenarios.
  - In the live streaming industry, color correction typically refers to DaVinci Resolve color correction, including color wheels, secondary curves, and custom curves. While these are included in DaVinci Resolve, many companies that build live streaming studios also use DaVinci Resolve for color correction. However, as a cutout software, these features are essential, as it allows for real-time, fast, and remote adjustments. Once a livestream studio is established, livestreams may not be broadcast live every day. This is when remote control is required. The fastest way to do this is to open the other person's computer and use the mouse to quickly adjust color. This is where lightweight curve color adjustment comes in handy. Or, if the user's camera image is already excellent and only requires simple adjustments, we recommend using the color adjustment features within LanSong Cutout for speed and efficiency.
4. Mature and stable.
In addition to cutout and color adjustment, there are also background blur and virtual cameras. This is because the entire processing flow, from camera acquisition to image, cutout, color adjustment, background blur, and final output, must be as complete as possible to ensure image integrity and avoid significant image quality loss.
As part of livestreaming software, stability is paramount. Some of LanSong Cutout's clients livestream 24/7, meaning they never shut down their computers from the moment they start. This requires long-term operation, and any memory leaks accumulate to significant amounts. Over time, this can lead to issues like insufficient computer memory. The LanSong Cutout plugin has proven itself in this area.
The LanSong Cutout plugin has gone through over 20 iterations and has been tested on numerous livestreaming computers. Each time a new version is released, it is livestreamed three times, each lasting two hours, to ensure maximum stability.
