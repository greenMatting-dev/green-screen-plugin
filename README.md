Version 5.3.0

2. Added the Hair Enhancement feature.
3. Optimized the selection interface for static protection.
4. Added fine-grained control for edge scaling.
5. Optimized edge blur.
6. Other optimizations.
7.

Version 5.2.0
1. Optimized the background blur feature, allowing you to apply various LUT filters to the image before blurring.
2. Optimized the virtual camera feature, allowing you to detect the camera even when is not open. The camera name has been changed to ZS-UHD-video.
3. Added the ability to upload logs.
4. Added the grayscale LUT feature.
5. Optimized the performance viewer interface.
6. Removed the "Capture in 4K" feature.
7. Optimized the automatic noise reduction algorithm.

---

Version 5.1.0
1. Added automatic background blur (without depth camera hardware detection), allowing you to blur the background in real time. The background blurs as people approach, but becomes clearer as they move away.
2. Added a fixed blur feature.
3. Color Optimization: Optimized brightness and RGB curve adjustments.
4. Color Optimization: Added warm and cool color adjustment.
5. Other Optimizations.

---
Version 5.0.0
1. Performance Optimization: Added GPU denoising. Added an automatic mode that automatically matches different denoising modes for graphics cards with different computing power.
2. Performance Optimization: Added a performance viewer. This allows real-time viewing of the current plugin's running status, facilitating performance optimization for low-end graphics cards.
3. Performance Optimization: Opened various camera parameter settings. With the default settings, parameters can now be re-set.
4. Effect Optimization: Added a post-calibration auxiliary graffiti feature for manual calibration, allowing for recalibration after graffiti, improving accuracy for details like hair.
5. Effect Optimization: Optimized the Transparency LUT filter.
6. Network authorization optimization.
7. Other optimizations.

---
Version 4.7.0
1. Added the AI Cutout feature to the Green Cutout function (can also cut out images with a white wall background. This is a trial version and is not recommended for actual use).
2. Optimized the filter version's cutout speed.
3. Color Correction: Customized curves and independent adjustment of three RGB components.
4. Color Correction: Optimized the color correction curve.
5. Color Correction: Added white balance calibration and black point calibration.
6. Added: Super-resolution processing at 1080p resolution.
7. Added the automatic detection of new versions.

---

Version 4.6.2
- Added several plug-ins to the filter:
1. <DaVinci Color Correction Filter (Lightweight)> plug-in
2. <Cutout Filter> plug-in
3. <Transparency Filter LUT> plug-in
- Optimized the noise reduction code.
- Optimized performance.

---

Version 4.6
- Added GPU support The denoising algorithm now runs entirely on the GPU, improving processing speed on machines with low-performance CPUs.
- Optimized processing speed for low-end NVIDIA graphics cards.
- Other performance optimizations. -

---

Version 4.5
- Added a new overflow algorithm for the "Fine" model; overflow control is more flexible, with the option to select yellow or blue without discoloration;
1. Added various color grading features
1. Customizable brightness curves
2. DaVinci Resolve primary color wheel
3. Secondary curves
2. Added image clarity function
3. Other optimizations.

Version 4.4
1. Added a "High-Quality Virtual Camera Module"; outputs images much more detailed than the built-in virtual camera;
2. Optimized image display details for a more realistic display;
3. Support for HDYC format;
4. Other image quality improvements.
---
Version 4.3
1. Optimized noise reduction algorithm
2. Added HD virtual camera
3. Optimized image quality.

---
Version 4.2
1. Performance optimization, CPU usage reduced by 40%;
2. GPU usage reduced by 20%;
3. Other Optimizations

---
Version 4.1
- December 27, 2024, 2:08:46 PM
1. Default capture speed for 3070 and above graphics cards is 4K.
2. Added leg lengthening feature.
3. Enabled noise reduction by default.
4. Added links to various demos.
5. Other performance optimizations.

---
Version 4.0
-
Updates:
1. Optimized image edges, including edge scaling while minimizing hair loss. [Major Update];
2. Removed dynamic protection (unrealistic and requiring a region). Color protection now preserves color without requiring a region.
3. Optimized the performance of color protection when setting a region.
4. Optimized the color protection interface, static protection interface, and image cropping interface.
5. Optimized denoising parameters.
6. Added a green keying feature in the form of an filter, allowing you to key out images or videos.
7. Increased the number of color protections to four. You can now select up to four different colors.

---
Version 3.2
Update Contents:
- Added blue screen keying
